The following is the self-assessment written for CS 499.

Completing the coursework throughout the program and developing my portfolio has been of great benefit to me in showing off my strengths and abilities as a developer, it's given me further understanding of what I value in my code and how I can write code that is of the highest quality such that anyone to come after me will be able to easily understand what has been created as well as what could be built off of it. I found the overall experience of the course to be quite meaningful as it gave me the freedom to look back at projects I didn't have the time to complete and decide to work on them more and bring them to a state that I'm more proud of to show off to potential employers.

The abilities I've developed as a professional over my classes in understanding better how to communicate and work in a way that is more beneficial for team environments will also be of great help in the future as previously I honestly had a lack in my skills regarding that but I believe I can confidently say that by now I can work with others and explain things to others in a way more befitting of a professional in the work environment.

The artifacts I have created so far showcase my abilities in a few different ways that are quite important, that being my software design skills, my software development skills, and my database skills, I think these three are greatly beneficial to my employability overall and by including them in my portfolio they will allow any employes to see what I am capable of creating when I'm working at my best.
