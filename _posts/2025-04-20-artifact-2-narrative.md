The following is the narrative written for Artifact 2 at the time the initial enhancement was completed.

1.	Briefly describe the artifact. What is it? When was it created?
The artifact is a MongoDB database, specifically a python file to access it and view it in a user friendly interface while interacting with it. It was created as part of the project in CS 370.

2.	Justify the inclusion of the artifact in your ePortfolio. Why did you select this item? What specific components of the artifact showcase your skills and abilities in software development? How was the artifact improved?
I selected this because it was the most recent experience with a database I had and one I could easily improve. I really wanted to just show a simple way I could make it more user friendly by adding additional sorting options and by modifying the pie chart to be more user friendly.

3.	Did you meet the course outcomes you planned to meet with this enhancement in Module One? Do you have any updates to your outcome-coverage plans?
Yes, I only listed the two aforementioned things as what I intended to do so I have completed those as I wished to.

4.	Reflect on the process of enhancing and modifying the artifact. What did you learn as you were creating it and improving it? What challenges did you face?
Honestly, it was very straightforward what I wanted to change and because I knew exactly how to do it I really had to issued implementing it. I did learn that I should implement these basic features as part of the original code though instead of waiting for it to be an enhancement.
