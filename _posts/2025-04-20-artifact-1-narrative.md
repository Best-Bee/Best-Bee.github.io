The following are the narratives written for Artifact 1 at the time the initial enhancements were completed.

Narrative 1: 


1.	Briefly describe the artifact. What is it? When was it created?

  The artifact is a WIP Minecraft mod that I started developing a few months ago. The basic description of the mod is that I wanted to create a mod that implemented custom weapons with custom rendering, custom animations, custom effects, and custom abilities. Currently I have completed the custom rendering to near completion (to a point where I can now implement as many weapons as I want in the way I want), I’m working on the animations for the primary functionality currently.

2.	Justify the inclusion of the artifact in your ePortfolio. Why did you select this item? What specific components of the artifact showcase your skills and abilities in software development? How was the artifact improved?
   
  I think this artifact will be a good addition to my ePortfolio because it shows that I can work on stuff that I want to work on on my own time, without being forced to work on it. In addition to this, the artifact encompasses quite a large amount of work, and by completing it, I will be able to show my ability to create an actual product that people would be interested in using (instead of it just being something for school).

  The improvements I made for this part of the project was that I condensed my code and restructured it, I removed unnecessary files that were bloat, and I added much more in depth comments that properly describe the code and how it is being used.

3.	Did you meet the course outcomes you planned to meet with this enhancement in Module One? Do you have any updates to your outcome-coverage plans?
   
  The initial plans I had were to remove unnecessary code and files as well as adding more detailed comments, while continuing to work on fixing things and making more of it. While I have not done much of that last part, I have done quite a bit of the first two. As for that last part, the only thing I managed to really do this week was that I fixed a bug that caused the item to not be lined up with where it should be on the ground (it was underground and off-center the moment it landed on the ground). So far, I do not really have many changes to my coverage plans although with how complex (and tedious) some of the stuff I will be working on is with animations, I may put solidifying the animations on hold and focus on implementing functionality first.

4.	Reflect on the process of enhancing and modifying the artifact. What did you learn as you were creating it and improving it? What challenges did you face?
   
  I learned that I need to comment my code as I’m working on it, or at least comment code that I have finalized, instead of just neglecting to do so in favor of working on the next thing. In addition, I need to keep in mind to mark files for deletion (or delete them) when they become redundant and unnecessary, as I had I have 7 files that were completely unused in my project.

1.	Briefly describe the artifact. What is it? When was it created?

  The artifact is a WIP Minecraft mod that I started developing a few months ago. The basic description of the mod is that I wanted to create a mod that implemented custom weapons with custom rendering, custom animations, custom effects, and custom abilities. Currently I have completed the custom rendering to near completion (to a point where I can now implement as many weapons as I want in the way I want), I’m working on bug fixes and implementing the secondary weapon ability currently.

2.	Justify the inclusion of the artifact in your ePortfolio. Why did you select this item? What specific components of the artifact showcase your skills and abilities in algorithms and data structure? How was the artifact improved?
   
  I decided to use this item mainly because it is a project I can be very motivated on and be willing to work on the most, in addition to this I think having a project like this can show my ability to adapt to existing systems and build off of them to make new things that people will enjoy using. The main things I’ve done with my modifications so far are honestly not as much as I would’ve like to do, I ended up getting stuck working on the animations for the weapon for longer than I expected and only had a little time to work on implementing the functionality I wanted to, however I have laid the basic framework by replicating the trident item’s code into the weapon I’ve created so now I can freely modify that to how I want and tinker with it until it’s what I want.

3.	Did you meet the course outcomes you planned to meet with this enhancement in Module One? Do you have any updates to your outcome-coverage plans?
   
  I do not think I fully met them, but I have made a substantial amount of progress towards it. There were some parts of the code I changed and looked at that I could not see a better way to make it, and some parts I could modify to make them very slightly better. In addition to that, I did fix some bugs that I found, and was unable to fix one bug that has to do with texture lighting. I do not think I’ve changed my plans on how much I plan to do, though. I have every intention of completing this project by the final submission date.

4.	Reflect on the process of enhancing and modifying the artifact. What did you learn as you were creating it and improving it? What challenges did you face?
   
  The main thing I learned is that referencing existing structures and design conventions in Minecraft is by far the easiest way to achieve a desired functionality. The main challenge I faced while making this was struggling and failing to fix a rendering code bug where the light level of the texture is dimmer than it should be, and nothing I could think of would fix it.
